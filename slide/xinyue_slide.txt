Let me talk about more on geographical aspects. This barplot gives us an idea how the uber users spread across the country. On this map, the darker places represent the more active states. We can see, in the US, people in CA, NY, TX and IL love to talk about Uber. The gray text on the map show the most frequently used word grouped by states. The following table can give you a closed look at those words.
New Yorkers love to talk about Uber’s new launched logo for some reason.
Californian, as the home of Uber, talk a lot about startup with Uber. As we all know, Uber is one of the fastest growing company in the world.
People in Florida and Illinois tend to talk Lyft and Uber together, as these companies have similar business and are very active in both states.
In Texas and Massachusetts, people tend to talk Uber with “Partner”, which may result from an expanding Uber business in those two states. Therefore, there are a lot of advertisements about “how to be a Uber partner”. “Uber partner” has the same meaning as “Uber driver”

Some questions maybe asked:
1. dataset: It is a subset of the total datasets with the location information in the tweets
2. colorbar about the plot: It is the normalized data with some monotonic transformation, so the scale does not really mean anything. If you want to know the number behind this, I am afraid we have to go back to original dataset.

 

In this graph, the darker color indicates the higher tweets volumn about Uber. They concentrate in East coast, west coast and Taxes. However, these states also owns largest population.

So this map is previous one normalized by state population. It is almost same, besides Nevada stands out. For the most frequent used words grouped by states. It is interesting New yorker love to talk about logo and florida talk a lot about the doctor.
